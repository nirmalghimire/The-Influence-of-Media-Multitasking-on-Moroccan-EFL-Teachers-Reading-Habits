# Influence of Media Multitasking on Moroccan EFL Teachers’ Reading Habits

This repository contains the data analysis and findings from a research project examining the impact of media multitasking on the reading habits of Moroccan English as a Foreign Language (EFL) teachers.

## Project Overview

The study investigates how frequent engagement in media multitasking—simultaneously handling multiple forms of digital media—affects EFL teachers' ability to engage with extended reading materials. Drawing on survey data, we explored correlations between digital media usage and reported reading behaviors.

## Data

- **Source:** Time diary survey responses collected from Moroccan EFL teachers.
- **Data Cleaning:** Conducted in R using `janitor::clean_names()` and other preprocessing steps.
- **Variables:** Included demographic info, frequency of digital media use, types of reading activities, and multitasking behaviors.

## Analysis

- Implemented in R, using packages such as `tidyverse`, `janitor`, and `ggplot2`.
- Key steps:
  - Cleaning and filtering the raw dataset
  - Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
  - Statistical modeling and visualization
- Focused on identifying patterns in reading habits and their relationship to multitasking tendencies.

## Key Findings

- Teachers frequently engaged in media multitasking reported reduced time for deep reading.
- Mobile device usage while reading was a significant predictor of shorter reading sessions.
- A subset of teachers maintained strong reading habits, often using strategies to manage distractions.
